# Unity Junior Programmer Pathway Unit 5 - User Interface

### Summary
In this Unit, you will program a game to test the player’s reflexes, where the goal is to click and destroy objects randomly tossed in the air before they can fall off the screen. In creating this prototype, you will learn how to implement a User Interface - or UI - into your projects. You will add a title screen with a difficulty select menu that will control how challenging the gameplay is, you will add a score display that will track how many points the player has earned, and you will add a Game Over screen, which will allow the player to restart and try again. In learning these skills, you will be able to create a fully “playable” experience that the user can enjoy from start to finish without having to restart the application to try it again.

### Optional Bonus Features
- [x] **Easy:** Lives UI
    - Create a "Lives" UI element that counts down by 1 when an object leaves the bottom of the screen and triggers Game Over when Lives reaches 0.
- [x] **Medium:** Music volume
    - Add background music and a UI Slider element to adjust the volume.
- [x] **Hard:** Pause menu
    - During gameplay, allow the user to press a key to toggle between pausing and resuming the game, where a pause screen comes up while the game is paused.
- [x] **Expert:** Click-and-swipe
    - Program click-and-swipe functionality instead of clicking, generating a trail where the mouse has been dragged. This does make the game easier, so you might also want to increase the gameplay difficulty on all levels if you implement this.
